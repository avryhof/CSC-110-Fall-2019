This is class material for CSC-110 at OCC.  If you are taking the class, I would hope your goal is to learn, and you
won't clone down this repo, and submit my work for your grade.

That being said, you can look at my work, and read about it, but if you foolishly submit it for a grade, or use it in a
commercial product, I reserve the right to sue you. (and you'll probably get punished by your school, too!)

This is more to protect me, and you than anything else.
