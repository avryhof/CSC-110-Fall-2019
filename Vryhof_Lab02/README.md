# Lab #2: Hello World Revisited
This lab takes you through expanding the Hello World program from Lab01 to input more complex data, and output it back
to the screen using escape sequences for new lines.

In this lab, it is handy to learn how to use the getline() function, so you can get the User's full name, and a book
title that includes spaces. (C'mon, everybody just read "DUNE", right?)  Reading Dune aside, you still need to get 
Frank Herbert's name in the next prompt, so learn about getline()...or since this is technically a Visual C++ course, 
cin.get().
