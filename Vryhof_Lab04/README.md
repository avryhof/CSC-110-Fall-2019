# Lab #3: Prompting and Formatting
This lab is about how to prompt the user for input (Which it seems I wasn't supposed to do yet in Lab 2).

I went ahead a little, and wrote a function to take care of input for me.  (If you look at my other repos, you'll see I 
am a Python developer)

Anyway, this isn't a whole lot different than Lab 2 for me.

Enjoy!
